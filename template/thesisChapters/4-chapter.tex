Please note that when you have entered your university code and the name of your department, only information which is relevant to your university and department, and which is covered by the relevant bilateral agreement will be displayed.

When you have completed the form, you will find at the bottom of the page a button called 'Attach Files'. This provides a link to where you can attach your completed university application form and Learning Agreement. If you have any special conditions or modifications to the Learning Agreement, you have to contact with your relevant departmental coordinator.

When you are finished, click 'Save' and then 'Send', in order the forms to be sent to this office. Once we have your completed forms we can pass them on to your coordinator here in Yıldız Technical University. Please note that The EU Office cannot make any changes to their form once it has been submitted. Once an understanding has been reached by the coordinators about their application, a Letter of Invitation will be prepared and sent to you.
